## Project Summary
This project develops a predictive model for the early detection of cognitive decline in older adults, implemented through microservices to enhance usability and scalability.

## Full Description

### Context
We are facing a global increase in the population of older adults, where cognitive decline is becoming a growing concern. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to address this significant challenge.

### Technical Challenge
Design a model that is accurate and efficient, capable of processing large volumes of clinical data to provide early and personalized diagnoses.

### Action Plan
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, standardization, and preliminary analysis.
2. **Model Development**: Feature selection and predictive modeling.
3. **Validation**: Cross-validation techniques to ensure model reliability.
4. **Optimization**: Model improvements using advanced optimization techniques.
5. **Monitoring and Updating**: Implementation of systems for continuous performance monitoring.
6. **Deployment**: Microservices using FastAPI and Docker.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- virtualenv
- Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/juancgiraldo/cognitive-decline-prediction.git
cd cognitive-decline-prediction

# Set up the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Setup

### IDE Configuration
It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the following extensions for an efficient development environment:
- Python
- Docker
- GitLens

### Python Environment Creation
We will use `virtualenv` to create an isolated environment that allows for safe and effective dependency management.

```bash
```

## Usage

### Running the Model
To start the server and expose the model as a microservice, run:

1. **Set up environment variables**:

```bash
# .env 
# Environment variables
DEBUG=True
HOST=
PORT= 
```

2. **Execute Docker**: 
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### API Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the model through the API generated by FastAPI, accessing the interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
